## Ruels and Guideline

This guide provides an overview of the policies and best practices for using the MedCMU High-Performance Computing (MedCMU-HPC) resources.

### General Policies

- Make sure you've reviewed the official MedCMU policies.
- We primarily communicate via your CMU email, so check it regularly.
- Keep your account secure and never share your login credentials.
- Don't try to bypass system restrictions or break the rules.
- Avoid actions that disrupt other users or compromise their data.
- Only use HPC resources for MedCMU research or training.
- Acknowledge MedCMU's contribution in your publications if applicable (see our attribution page for details).


### Job Schedule Submission

- Use appropriate resources for your jobs. Don't use specialized resources like GPU unless absolutely necessary.
- Login nodes are for managing jobs, not computations.
- Submit a manageable number of jobs. Ideally, keep it under 4 on HPC-Med. We may request job modifications or termination to ensure smooth system operation.


### Data Storage

- Project leaders manage and are responsible for their project directories.
- Store only research data on the HPC system. Personal data, non-research media, and backups from other devices are prohibited.
- Illegal content is strictly forbidden and may lead to legal repercussions.
